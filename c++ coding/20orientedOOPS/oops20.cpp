// *************  Procedure Oriented Programing (POP)  *************
// 1) Consist of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
// 2) Main focus is on function not on flow of Data
// 3) Function can use Either local or global data
// 4) Data moves openly from function to function

// *************  Object Oriented Programing (OOP)     **************
// 2) Works on the concept of classes and objects
// 3) A class is a template to create object
// 4) Treats the Data as a critical element     (Applying restrictions on data)
// 5) Decomposes the problems in object and builds data and functions arround the objects

// ******** Basic concepts in Object Oriented Programing (OOP) *********
// CLASS  : Basic template for creating objects.
// OBJECT : Basic run time entities.
// Data Abstraction and Encapsulation : Raping data and function into single units.
// Inheritance : Properties of one class can be inheritant into others.
// Polymorphism : Ability to take more then one forms.
// Dynamic Binding : Code which will execute, will not known until the program runs.
// Message Passing : Object.message(information) call formate.

// ********** Benefits of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) *************
// Better code reusabilty using objects and inheretance.
// Principle of data hiding build hepls secure systems.
// Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference.
// Software complexity can be managed easity.
